  ## Description
  
   The Deep Thoughts application which allows users to post their thoughts, was built using React, Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB, which makes it a MERN application. 
   Moving forward, we'll deploy this app to the cloud and replace the back-end API with cloud resources to handle the storage, database, and computing.

   We've chosen Amazon Web Services, or AWS, to fulfill this role. We chose AWS over other providers, like Microsoft Azure or the Google Cloud Platform, because AWS is currently the most comprehensive and widely adopted cloud platform. 
   AWS offers the widest range of web services, a vast array of customers (from startups to enterprise), and an extensive free tier.
